this is the repository for the second assignment:

The folder: 'code' contains all the code for all 3 subquestions seperately. and the code can be run on its own.
Note that Assignment2_mvd.ipynb contains 2.1

each file in the code folder shows what packages are imported, install these if necessary.


The folder 'figures' contains all generated figures. However, no figures have been generated that are not in the report, hence this file is not as relevant.
